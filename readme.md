## Overview

Simple organisation of recurring tasks distributed among multiple team members.

## Intention

Create a simple app, where daily recurring tasks can be distributed and organized over a group of people.
Like car-sharing, cooking, attendance ... 

## Codingstyle

I've tried something experimental here. Looks good so far in my option. Like a hybrid constiting of coffee/python intending and classic js syntax.
